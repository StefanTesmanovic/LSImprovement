# The project explanation in English
  The projects goal is to improve an extractive text summarization method called LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). LSI uses SVD (Singular Value Decomoposition) to decompose and perform dimensionality reduction the word-sentence matrix. Because of the dimensionality reduction the calculation time is reduced and only the most relevant information is preserved. The resault of SVD is an approximation matrix with the rank k (k<n, where n is the rank of the original matrix) that has the smallest possible euclidian distance from the original matrix. The improvement consists of: using the tf-idf metric instead of the word-sentence matrix, changing the formula for paragraphing, and preprocessing the text by lematising it.
